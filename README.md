# Link Translator

**Link Translator** is a simple web-based utility that translates between English and a playful "Grunt" language inspired by Link from *The Legend of Zelda* series. Featuring a clean interface, dark mode support, and an animated Navi cursor, this project blends nostalgia with functionality for fans and fun-seekers alike.

## Background

This project began as a joke in a Pok√©mon ROM hacking Facebook group, sparked by a playful comment about translating English into Link-style grunts. What started as a meme quickly evolved into a polished web tool thanks to community encouragement and ongoing development. It now stands as a fun tribute to Zelda fans with a surprisingly useful and interactive design.
